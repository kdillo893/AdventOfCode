# Goals for Advent of Code 2024
I want to use concurrency and multi-threading for learning purposes.

I'll probably start learning Go and go back to other languages that I've touched
on in the past in school, like C and Python, then figure out how to multi-thread
things appropriately with Java.

The first problem is "solve it simply", then to "solve it piecewise with concurrency",
and develop a mechanism for fetching next things to process per thread.
